This is a grouping of GSON and Volley examples. It makes a server request to the Lacuna Expanse web api with serialized data, returns a string, deserializes the string using GSON, builds a new string back up to send a new request using data parsed from the deserialized data and then sends one last request to the server. It then prints the results in the logcat. If you want to use it, you will need to update the username and password located in the SerializeRequest class on lines 27-28
